# Discrete Clothoids

Test implementation of discrete clothoid curves and discrete log-aesthetic curves.

Originally written in Julia (with Gtk GUI); but later a C++ version was also added (to be used from other programs).
The latter uses [my geometry library](https://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom).
